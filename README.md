# Rename-By-Tags-GUI
Program i've written to help me keep my music library organized, might add support for more filestypes if I ever see the need (for now .flac & .mp3). For now it can,

 - Rename files in format: Tracknumber - Tracktitle (01 - Title).
 - Save done changes to CSV (old title & new title)
 - Cleanup Title (non caps to caps etc. etc.), not working with csv.
